      Blue Dawn is a community initiative/support group working by values of community healing and a facilitator of accessible mental health services to Bahujans.
    </p>
    <p>
      We connect Bahujan people in need of mental health counseling with counselors who understand the intersection
      of mental health and caste/minority issues, and with sponsors who can help make mental health counseling accessible to our community.
